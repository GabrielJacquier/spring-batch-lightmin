= Spring Batch Lightmin
:toc:
:asciidoctor-source: ./spring-batch-lightmin-documentation/src/main/asciidoc

The _Spring Batch Lightmin_ is a library on top of the _Spring Batch_ Framework. It provides the basic _Spring
Batch_ infrastructure components

* JobRepository
* JobOperator
* JobExplorer
* JobLauncher
* JobBuilderFactory
* StepBuilderFactory

and depending beans.

To monitor the Spring Batch Jobs, the _Spring Batch Lightmin_ provides a web interface. The web interface also
manages _JobConfigurations_, which can be used for time triggered job runs.

The documentation can be found at http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tuxdevelop/spring-batch-lightmin/blob/next/spring-batch-lightmin-documentation/src/main/doc/spring_batch_lightmin.html[Spring Batch Linghtmin Documentation]

== Getting Started

=== Maven Dependencies

=== Enable Spring Batch Lightmin

To enable the _Spring Batch Lightmin_, you have to add the _@EnableSpringBatchLightminUI_ annotation to a
Spring configuration class of your application. The _Spring Batch Lightmin_ also needs a bean of type
_JobConfigurationRepository_ in the application context. The easiest implementation of _JobConfigurationRepository_
is the _MapJobConfigurationRepository_.

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSpringBatchLightminUI
public class AddressMigratorApp {

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(AddressMigratorApp.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public JobConfigurationRepository jobConfigurationRepository(){
        return new MapJobConfigurationRepository();
    }

}
----

=== Jdbc Support
For production environments, the _Spring Batch Lightmin_ also provides jdbc components, to get the _Spring Batch Job_
 meta informations from a database and to store the _JobConfigurations_. To use a persistent way to store your
 _JobConfigurations_, you have to install a schema of _Spring Batch Lightmin_ next to your _Spring Batch_ tables.
 The DDL scripts for various database types are located within the core-module of the _Spring Batch Lightmin_.

[source, java]
----

@Autowired
private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

@Value("${table.prefix}")
private String tablePrefix;

@Bean
public JobConfigurationRepository jobConfigurationRepository() {
    return new JdbcJobConfigurationRepository(jdbcTemplate, tablePrefix);
}

----

==== Properties

If you have to use a different table prefix for the Spring Batch database schema and the job configuration database
schema, you have to set the _table.prefix_ property in your application.properties. The default value is _BATCH__.

[source,properties]
----
table.prefix=MY_BATCH_PREFIX_
----

== Spring Batch Lightmin UI

=== Index

The welcome page of the _Spring Batch Lightmin_ shows the hostname/ip-address and the servlet path of the current
instance. At this point, all available REST-endpoints and operations are also listed. In order to get deeper into the
_Lightmin_, you have to navigate through the top bar.

=== Jobs

On startup, the _Spring Batch Lightmin_ scans the _Spring Context_ to register all beans of the type _Job_ and make
them available into the _JobRegistry_. All known jobs will be listed in the jobs tab with their current instance count.
To get more detailed informations about the job instances, you have to click on the job name, you want to view.

==== Job Instances

After selecting a job by name, all instances of the job will be listed with their current execution count. In order
to get more detailed information about the executions of the instance, select the desired job instance id.

==== Job Executions

The view will show an overview of all executions for the selected instance id. To get detailes of the job execution,
click on the desired id.

==== Job Execution

The job execution view shows you a detailed overview about the job and step executions of the selected job execution.

=== Admin

==== Job Configurations

The job configurations view gives an overview about all stored job configurations. At this point, you can add and delete
 new job configurations, start and stop the scheduler of the job configurations and edit existing configurations.
