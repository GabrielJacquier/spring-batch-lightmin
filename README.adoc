The _Spring Batch Lightmin_ is a library on top of the _Spring Batch_ Framework. It provides the basic _Spring
Batch_ infrastructure components

* JobRepository
* JobOperator
* JobExplorer
* JobLauncher
* JobBuilderFactory
* StepBuilderFactory

and depending beans.

To monitor the Spring Batch Jobs, the _Spring Batch Lightmin_ provides a web interface. The web interface also
manages _JobConfigurations_, which can be used for time triggered job runs.

The documentation can be found at http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tuxdevelop/spring-batch-lightmin/blob/next/spring-batch-lightmin-documentation/src/main/doc/spring_batch_lightmin.html[Spring Batch Linghtmin Documentation]

== Getting Started

=== Maven Dependencies

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.tuxdevelop</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-lightmin-ui</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

In order to get the latest _SNAPSHOTS_, you have to activate the sonatype snapshot repository.

[source,xml]

        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
----

=== Enable Spring Batch Lightmin

To enable the _Spring Batch Lightmin_, you have to add the _@EnableSpringBatchLightminUI_ annotation to a
Spring configuration class of your application.

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSpringBatchLightminUI
public class AddressMigratorApp {

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(AddressMigratorApp.class, args);
    }

}
----

=== Jdbc Support
For production environments, the _Spring Batch Lightmin_ also provides jdbc components, to get the _Spring Batch Job_
 meta informations from a database and to lightminApplicationRepository the _JobConfigurations_. To use a persistent way to lightminApplicationRepository your
 _JobConfigurations_, you have to install a schema of _Spring Batch Lightmin_ next to your _Spring Batch_ tables.
 The DDL scripts for various database types are located within the core-module of the _Spring Batch Lightmin_.
 If a _DataSource_ bean is available in the context, the _Spring Batch Lightmin_ will create a
 _JdbcJobConfigurationRepository_.

==== Properties

If you have to use a different table prefix for the Spring Batch database schema and the job configuration database
schema, you have to set the _*-table-prefix_ properties in your application.properties. The default value is _BATCH__.
The _Spring Batch Lightmin_ configuration tries to create _Jdbc_-components, if a bean of type _DataSource_ is
available within the _Spring Context_. The _*-force-map_-properties can override the behavior and let the _Spring
Batch Lightmin_ create _Map_-components.

[source,properties]
----
#Set the table prefix for Spring Batch tables, default BATCH_
spring.batch.lightmin.repository-table-prefix=MY_BATCH_PREFIX
#Set the table prefix for Spring Batch Lightmin configuration tables, default BATCH__
spring.batch.lightmin.configuration-table-prefix=MY_BATCH_PREFIX_
#If set to true, a MapJobRepository will be created, default false
spring.batch.lightmin.repository-force-map=false
#If set to true, a MapJobConfigurationRepository will be created, default false
spring.batch.lightmin.configuration-force-map=false

== Spring Batch Lightmin UI

=== Index

The welcome page of the _Spring Batch Lightmin_ shows the hostname/ip-address and the servlet path of the current
instance. At this point, all available REST-endpoints and operations are also listed. In order to get deeper into the
_Lightmin_, you have to navigate through the top bar.

=== Jobs

On startup, the _Spring Batch Lightmin_ scans the _Spring Context_ to register all beans of the type _Job_ and make
them available into the _JobRegistry_. All known jobs will be listed in the jobs tab with their current instance count.
To get more detailed informations about the job instances, you have to click on the job name, you want to view.

==== Job Instances

After selecting a job by name, all instances of the job will be listed with their current execution count. In order
to get more detailed information about the executions of the instance, select the desired job instance id.

==== Job Executions

The view will show an overview of all executions for the selected instance id. To get detailes of the job execution,
click on the desired id.

==== Job Configurations

The job configurations view gives an overview about all stored job configurations. At this point, you can add and delete
 new job configurations, start and stop the scheduler of the job configurations and edit existing configurations.
